# Vision-Enhanced LLM

## Overview
This project integrates vision capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to process and understand images. The model can generate image captions and perform question answering (Q&A) on images, making it useful for applications in accessibility, automated image understanding, and interactive AI systems.

### Key Tasks:
- **Captioning**: Generate meaningful and accurate captions for images.
- **Q&A on Images**: Answer questions based on image content.

## Features
- **Image Caption Generation**: Automatically generate descriptive captions for images.
- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Answer questions related to input images.
- **Multimodal Processing**: Combines NLP and vision models to enhance AI understanding.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment.
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the notebook to process images and interact with the model.
```sh
jupyter notebook Multimodal_Large_Language_Models.ipynb
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on the backend used)
- Transformers (Hugging Face)
- OpenCV, PIL (for image processing)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Future Improvements
- Support for more complex multimodal tasks.
- Fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets.
- Real-time image understanding for interactive applications.
